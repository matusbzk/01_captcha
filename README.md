# AoC2017
Advent of Code 2017 in Haskell

I decided to do [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017) in Haskell. I am doing this mainly to challenge myself.

Some of these solutions are very inefficient and cannot calculate the actual result. Sometimes, I calculated the result in C#, sometimes I found better Haskell solutions on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/), but I do not want to upload solutions that are not mine.
